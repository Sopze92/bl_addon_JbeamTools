# Blender UNOFFICIAL Jbeam-Tools Addon

### JBEAM tools:
for BeamNG Modding

I don't like the official **Jbeam editor for Blender** so I'm making a simpler one with the tools i really need, unlike the official, this one supports **Ctrl-Z** as it works along with a standard blender mesh

any mesh can be non-destructively turned into a Jbeam-data-holder, it stores te JBeam data as vertex/edge attributes, currently the features are:

- naming nodes (vertex attributes)
- real-time visuzalization of node names in all 3D viewports
- copy selected vertex / edges as Nodes / Beams respectively to later paste them directly on your Jbeam files, (respecting selection order)

#### coming up:

- toggle `l`, `ll`, `r`, `rr` on all selected node names
- automatic name numeration on selected nodes (by selection order)
- change node name but no numeration nor side
- duplicate node name / beam warning

#### NOT planned:
- collision tris
